> Im making great progress with this tutorial

I just made a custom post-4 to update on my progress
Now:
- my blog posts are wrapped around a `MarkdownPostLayout.astro`
- and my `MarkdownPostLayout.astro` is wrapped around my site wide `BaseLayout.astro`
___
As a Basic the `MarkdownPostLayout.astro` file has all the things that are repeated in all the blog posts.
