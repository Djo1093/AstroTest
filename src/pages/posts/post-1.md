This is my first post in the .md format first time for me writing a .md file raw ive used them in obsidian but never written them down in any other app

## What ive learned

1. Installing astro with atro@latest(check command in official wiki)
2. **.astro**files and making different pages with `.astro` format
3. Linking different pages with a tag `<a href="/address of link/">`Name of link`</a>`
4. creating a .md file and writing in it

## Next
keep updating these blogs as i learn more, excited to get into css and prettfying things.
